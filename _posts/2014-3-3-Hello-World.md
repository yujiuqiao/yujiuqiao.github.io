title: About Me
---

As a artificial intelligence assistant researcher, currently I'm working on the area of mathematical modeling, applied math algorithms and deep learning.
I'm currently a undergraduate student at Beijing National Day School of China. During studying I took the 7th [Annual International Mathematical Modeling Challenge](https://immchallenge.org/) and our team won the first place. 
Currently I'm a assistance researcher with a team of [Ailinkup](www.ailinkup.cn) under the scope of unsupervised deep learning.
